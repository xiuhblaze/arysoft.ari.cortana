          <i>GFSI Benchmarking Requirements Add&nbsp;New Scope.</i>
          <br /><br />
          At the March Steering Committee meeting of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), was made to 
          approve the publication of a new scope to the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements version 2020. This 
          new scope covers the provision of services impacting food safety and is the result of two years 
          of work by a group of experts who generously volunteered their time to advance food safety with 
          GFSI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many services provided to primary processing, food manufacturing and food retail, such as laundry, 
          pest control, lab services, sanitation, contracted maintenance, etc. are critical to their 
          pre-requisite programmes and ultimately food safety. The GFSI Board identified an opportunity 
          for a GFSI-recognised certification programme to help the food industry select service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          GFSI seeked food safety professionals and services provision experts to participate in a new Technical 
          Working Group (TWG) established to create a new scope of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements that will 
          address services for provision to primary processing, food manufacturing and food retail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Group's Mandate.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This group worked on Scope I - Provision of Food Safety Services, and will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provided detailed definitions of the scopes and services covered by it.</li>
          <li>Produced a review of existing certifications applicable to those services.</li>
          <li>Established “Benchmarking Requirements” for the key parameters for those specified services.</li>
          <li>Reviewed the “Benchmarking Requirements glossary” in light of the new scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can find the new scope, coded as scope H, amongst the full GFSI Benchmarking Requirements 
          version 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potential candidates are now being asked to apply for GFSI recognition against this new scope.           
          This is an essential step to make GFSI-recognized certification available to providers of the 
          aforementioned services.

          <strong>PARIS, 16th August 2021</strong>
           - Global Food Safety Initiative, The Consumer Goods Forum's Coalition of Action on food safety, 
           is pleased to announce that four more companies have joined its ranks. The four companies - Develey, 
           Kerry, Spinneys and Sysco - are now part of a unique group that is collaborating across borders to 
           ensure safe food for everyone. The Coalition now totals <a href="https://theconsumergoodsforum.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9e0d61eb5db549eb768d6c48b&amp;id=89bc31ddd9&amp;e=42fc2af780">38 companies</a>, 
           all of whom are members of The Consumer Goods Forum.
          </p>
          <p>
           Around the world, an estimated 600 million people - almost 1 in 10 - fall ill after eating contaminated 
           food each year and concerns over food safety have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To tackle 
           this, Coalition members are addressing challenges facing food safety systems in their supply chains and 
           the markets they operate in and are helping to raise the food safety bar globally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone has the right to access safe, nutritious, and nourishing food which is why GFSI's work 
            is&nbsp;critical to every community across the globe. As one of the world's leading networks to 
            help achieve&nbsp;safe food, GFSI is committed to making food safety everyone's business.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sophie&nbsp;Kaiser, Lead unit QM Management Systems at Develey's department of Quality and 
              Risk Management</strong>, said, “As a family-owned and operated company, we think in terms of 
              generations and rely on sustainable economic business practices and quality without compromise. 
              This is the only way our company will remain competitive and can be handed down. As long-time 
              members of The Consumer Goods Forum, we understand the need to drive actions on the key challenges 
              impacting our industry. Food safety is one such area that many people take for granted, but there 
              is a lot of work going on behind the scenes and the GFSI Coalition is one of the key groups ensuring 
              the food safety bar continues to be raised. We are proud to be a part of such a group”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hugo Gutierrez,&nbsp;Global Food Safety &amp; Quality Officer at Kerry</strong>, said, 
              “Kerry is an innovative&nbsp;company and our business is all about helping our customers to develop 
              delicious and nutritious&nbsp;food with unparalleled consumer appeal. In the last few years, in our 
              journey to achieve word class&nbsp;food safety, we have invested in state-of-the-art food safety 
              programmes and innovated behavioural change programmes. We apply these latest innovations and behaviours 
              not only to our products, but to areas such as sustainability and food safety. If it's not safe, it's 
              not food, and we are wholly committed to GFSI's approach to improving food safety standards for 
              businesses. We look forward to working together, sharing our own knowledge and experiences with the 
              group. And as stated in our moto we all need to live by “Safety first, Quality always!”.

              glad to be a part of the GFSI Coalition, a key part of the Consumer Goods Forum. The CGF and the 
              Coalition is well placed to support our efforts to build capabilities at a local, regional and 
              international level. Our team at Spinneys is eager and delighted to join the GFSI, as the Coalition 
              is as committed as we are to delivering safe food through tangible actions and knowledge sharing in 
              a practical, analytical and adaptive manner”.

              <strong>Mitch Gilgour, Sysco's Senior Director, Quality Assurance: </strong>“Our mission is to deliver

              represents a key industry collaboration that is critical to helping us to deliver safe food to our 
              customers around the world. We look forward to working with our food safety peers to ensure the highest 
              levels of food safety versus the lowest level of compliance, and GFSI can help us achieve this”.
