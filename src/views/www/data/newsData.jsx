          <i>GFSI Benchmarking Requirements Add&nbsp;New Scope.</i>
          <br /><br />
          At the March Steering Committee meeting of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), was made to 
          approve the publication of a new scope to the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements version 2020. This 
          new scope covers the provision of services impacting food safety and is the result of two years 
          of work by a group of experts who generously volunteered their time to advance food safety with 
          GFSI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many services provided to primary processing, food manufacturing and food retail, such as laundry, 
          pest control, lab services, sanitation, contracted maintenance, etc. are critical to their 
          pre-requisite programmes and ultimately food safety. The GFSI Board identified an opportunity 
          for a GFSI-recognised certification programme to help the food industry select service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          GFSI seeked food safety professionals and services provision experts to participate in a new Technical 
          Working Group (TWG) established to create a new scope of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements that will 
          address services for provision to primary processing, food manufacturing and food retail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Group's Mandate.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This group worked on Scope I - Provision of Food Safety Services, and will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provided detailed definitions of the scopes and services covered by it.</li>
          <li>Produced a review of existing certifications applicable to those services.</li>
          <li>Established “Benchmarking Requirements” for the key parameters for those specified services.</li>
          <li>Reviewed the “Benchmarking Requirements glossary” in light of the new scope.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can find the new scope, coded as scope H, amongst the full GFSI Benchmarking Requirements 
          version 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potential candidates are now being asked to apply for GFSI recognition against this new scope.           
          This is an essential step to make GFSI-recognized certification available to providers of the 
          aforementioned services.

          <strong>PARIS, 16th August 2021</strong>
           - Global Food Safety Initiative, The Consumer Goods Forum's Coalition of Action on food safety, 
           is pleased to announce that four more companies have joined its ranks. The four companies - Develey, 
           Kerry, Spinneys and Sysco - are now part of a unique group that is collaborating across borders to 
           ensure safe food for everyone. The Coalition now totals <a href="https://theconsumergoodsforum.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9e0d61eb5db549eb768d6c48b&amp;id=89bc31ddd9&amp;e=42fc2af780">38 companies</a>,

          </p>
          <p>
           Around the world, an estimated 600 million people - almost 1 in 10 - fall ill after eating contaminated 
           food each year and concerns over food safety have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To tackle 
           this, Coalition members are addressing challenges facing food safety systems in their supply chains and 
           the markets they operate in and are helping to raise the food safety bar globally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone has the right to access safe, nutritious, and nourishing food which is why GFSI's work

        <p>
          As a result of the health contingency due to COVID-19, uncertainty has arisen in certified companies or 
          companies that are in the certification process as a result of the closure of activities required by the 
          health authorities for several months, for this reason some organizations were affected in their processes 
          and activities and have suffered a slight change or delay. This has led to a general concern and question 
          in these companies ... What will happen to my certification audit?
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to dispel these doubts, we present below alternatives of how the audit activities can be carried 
          out during this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently there are official documents from our accreditation body, as well as from the International 
          Accreditation Forum (IAF), which give us clearer guidance on what alternative techniques can be used to 
          provide an audit service that meets the established requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          IAF <a href="https://www.iaf.nu/upFiles/IAFID32011_Management_of_Extraordinary_Events_or_Circumstances.pdf">ID3</a> (Informative 
          Document for the Management of Events or Extraordinary Circumstances that Affect Certification Bodies ...), this document 
          has the purpose of exhausting any possibility that the on-site audit can be performed to guarantee health and safety both 
          of the audit team of the Certification Body, as well as the personnel of the Certified Organizations, in addition to 
          having the objective of providing the best possible service and making sure not to affect the certification due to 
          non-compliance "as well as to maintain a solid accredited certification and guarantee that certified organizations 
          receive the best possible service, for this they must have the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assess the risks involved in remote audits</li>
          <li>Establish a Policy for conducting remote audits</li>
          <li>
            Document a process that describes the steps to take in case of a certified organization is affected by an 
            extraordinary event.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the above, the certification body must collect information in order to carry out an evaluation and determine the 
          feasibility of performing the remote audit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When will the organization be able to function normally?</li>
          <li>When will the organization be able to ship products or perform the defined service within the current scope of certification?</li>
          <li>Will the organization need to use alternative manufacturing and / or distribution sites? If so, are they currently covered by the current certification or will they need to be evaluated?</li>
          <li>Does the existing inventory still meet customer specifications, or will the certified organization contact its customers regarding potential concessions?</li>
          <li>If the certified organization is certified to a management system standard that requires a disaster recovery plan or an emergency response plan, has the certified organization implemented the plan and was it effective?</li>
          <li>Will some of the processes and / or services performed or products sent be subcontracted to other organizations? If so, how will the certified organization control the activities of the other organizations?</li>
          <li>To what extent has the operation of the management system been affected?</li>
          <li>Has the certified organization carried out an impact assessment?</li>
          <li>Identification of alternative sampling sites, as appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          According to the IAF declaration on COVID-19 referring to remote audits and the Mandatory Document 
          (IAF <a href="https://www.iaf.nu/upFiles/IAF%20MD4%20Issue%202%2003072018.pdf">MD4</a>) for the Use of Information and 
          Communication Technologies for Audit and Evaluation Purposes, in which the criteria that must be covered to be able to 
          carry them out, in theory it is possible to carry out 100% remote audits, as long as all the requirements of the standard 
          to be audited can be evaluated, however, there are some regulations that limit this use since the audit objectives may not 
          be achieved, needing to perform part of the audit on site to evaluate the implementation and verification of specific 
          operational controls that due to their level of risk must be evaluated on site (e.g., ISO 22000, HACCP, etc.); the 
          certification body must evaluate each particular case with each of its clients and document the assessed risks.
        </p>
        <p>In the case of Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, it is only allowed to carry out the 100% remote evaluation during the period from May 07 to November 07, 2020 (see Answer 24 in the IAF link regarding <a href="https://iaffaq.com/faqs/">FAQs</a>), this means that process control and OH&amp;S risk control can be audited using remote auditing techniques until the end of the COVID-19 emergency.</p><p>If the ICT audit approach is considered to be a viable option, the means to be used will be tested with the certified organization prior to the remote audit to confirm that they are appropriate, adequate and effective; feasibility also depends on the quality of the online connection. Weak bandwidth or limited hardware capacity can slow the process to the point of inefficiency.</p><p>In all cases that the ICTs used do not work properly or prevent a sound audit, it will be suspended, and the appropriate follow-up actions will be determined.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            Verified the FSMS is effective and has improvement processes in place to:
            <ol>
              <li>handle and withdraw/recall as necessary potentially unsafe products,</li>
              <li>correct any nonconformities that do occur (including product nonconformities that are detected after delivery),</li>
              <li>analyze the cause of nonconformities and take corrective action to avoid their recurrence and verify effectiveness on the corrective actions taken,</li>
              <li>address complaints from all relevant interested parties.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Implemented monitoring and verification activities, an effective internal audit and management review process.</li>

            Products will never need to be withdrawn/recalled. A Food Safety Management&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certified to ISO 22000 
            should provide confidence in the organization's ability to “consistently provide safe food to customer requirements 
            for the consumer”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Products are certified. ISO 22000 is a set of requirements for “management system certification” not “product certification”. 
            ISO 22000 requires that an organization develop and implement a management system for managing product safety and ensuring 
            effectiveness of the system with regards to achieving expected outcomes and planned results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Full regulatory compliance has been verified by an accredited certification body. ISO 22000 certification requires 
            that the implementing organization comply with statutory and regulatory requirements and voluntary requirements to 
            which an organization subscribes. It does not guarantee the regulatory compliance oversight as this is the 
            responsibility of regulatory authorities.

    title: 'How does conformity assessment help the circular economy?',
    subtitle: 'Conformity assessment provides assurance that specified needs or expectations are being met.',

        <p className="text-end"><strong>May 11th, 2023</strong></p>
        <p><i>“Conformity assessment provides assurance that specified needs or expectations are being met.”</i></p>
        <p>
          Current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption cause environmental degradation, resource depletion and waste, 
          while accentuating inequalities between countries. There is an urgent need to move towards a more circular model that 
          redefines the economy around the principles of designing waste and pollution and keeping products and materials in use 
          for as long as possible.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>What is the circular economy?</strong></h4>
        <p>
          The circular economy is emerging as the new approach to achieve sustainable economic development. The circular economy 
          ensures that products are reused as many times as possible and materials are recycled, thereby reducing the need to 
          extract resources from nature.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Benefits of the circular economy:</strong></h4>
        <img className="img-fluid float-end" src="/images/ditc-ted-circular-economy-Benefits-1-450_0.jpg" alt="The Circular Economy" />
        <ul>
          <li>Minimize pollution and waste.</li>
          <li>Extend product life cycles.</li>
          <li>Allow the broad exchange of natural assets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          “A circular process must encompass both tangible and intangible requirements, including sustainability of the global 
          value chain based on aspects such as trade, economic factors, corporate responsibility, labour, health and human rights.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Several Organizations, including ISO, are developing sustainability standards at the national and international level, 
          with a specific focus on a circular economy. From eco-design standards that consider the sustainable consumption of 
          materials, energy and other resources to design requirements for product durability, reuse, upgradability and repair 
          and for the recyclability of devices such as electronic displays, commercial refrigeration appliances, washing machines 
          and vacuum cleaners.
        </p>
        <p>“The ISO portfolio of standards helps organizations assess the impacts of climate change and establish plans for effective action”.</p>
        <p>
          “Although standards already exist to cover different aspects of a circular economy, conformity assessment offers tools to 
          demonstrate that these specifications are met and therefore provides confidence to the market, which is needed more than ever”.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Conformity assessment.</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Conformity assessment standards apply defined rules and procedures to demonstrate and ensure compliance with the 
          requirements set forth in standards, regulations, contracts, programs, or other regulatory documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conformity assessment activities are carried out by Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). These organizations are governed 
          by a series of international ISO/IEC 17000 standards that guarantee the reliability of their activities based on requirements 
          of competence, impartiality, and coherent functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various types of conformity assessment activities that can provide confidence to economic actors during the 
          transition to a circular economy, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing:</strong> Determine the characteristics of a test item or sample (the object of conformity assessment) 
            according to a procedure. Requirements for testing and calibration laboratories are specified in the ISO/IEC 17025 
            standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inspection:</strong> examination of an item (the object of conformity assessment) and determination of its 
            conformity with detailed requirements or, on the basis of professional judgement, with general requirements. Requirements 
            for inspection bodies are specified in the ISO/IEC 17020 standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validation</strong>:&nbsp;Confirmation that the information declared as “claim” (the object of conformity 
            assessment) is plausible with regard to the intended future use. Requirements for validation bodies are specified 
            in the ISO/IEC 17029 standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification:</strong> confirmation that the information declared as “claim” (the object of conformity assessment) 
            is truthfully stated. Requirements for verification bodies are specified in the ISO/IEC 17029 standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Certification:</strong> Independent (third-party) attestation of conformity. Requirements for 
            certification bodies are specified in the standards ISO/IEC 17021-1 (for management systems as objects 
            of conformity assessment), ISO/IEC 17065 (for products, processes, and services as objects of conformity 
            assessment) and ISO/IEC 17024 (for persons as objects of conformity assessment).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Conformity assessment builds credibility that products, processes, services, systems or claims meet 
          specific requirements in circular economy aspects such as recyclability, reusability, repairability, 
          upgradability, etc.

        <p>
          The Foundation FSSC 22000 is proud to announce its newly developed Version 5 of the FSSC 22000 certification Scheme. 
          This new edition incorporates all the improvements included in the new ISO 22000 standard which has been published 
          in June 2018
        </p>
        <p>
          “The adoption of the new ISO 22000 high level structure in Version 5 provides a great opportunity for organizations 
          to enable the integration of their food safety management system with other management systems such as ISO 9001 for 
          quality management. Along with a focus on operational risks, there is now additional consideration for organizational 
          risks and opportunities which enable more sustainable and consistent business practices for all stakeholders along 
          the food supply chain.”

        <img src="/images/31k-1.jpg" className="img-fluid float-end" />
        <p>
          ISO 31000:2018, Risk management - Guidelines, provides principles, framework and a process for managing risk. It can 
          be used by any organization regardless of its size, activity or sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of 
          opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, ISO 31000 cannot be used for certification purposes, but does provide guidance for internal or external audit 
          programmes. Organizations using it can compare their risk management practices with an internationally recognised 
          benchmark, providing sound principles for effective management and corporate governance.
